Retrospective meetings can take various different forms, but the underlying aim is always the same: reflection on what has happened to improve how things are done going forward.

The 'Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel' method is, as the name suggests, focused on figuring out what is working and what isn't. What works should be done more of, and vice-versa. It's a birds-eye look at the processes as a whole that facilitates meta discussions about them.

Another general, but more emotion-focused technique is 'Glad, Sad, Mad'. Here, team members focus on what parts of the iteration has elicited one of those emotions in order to maximize the Glad, and minimize the other two.

The idea behind having various types of retrospectives is that a team can apply the one that they see as most suitable for them.
